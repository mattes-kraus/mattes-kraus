Hi, I am Mattes.

I am a Computer Science student in Germany, specializing in Imitation Learning and robot swarms! I studied in Konstanz and now start my masters at TUM in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence.

Feel free to check out my works towards my thesis or my small hangman solver. I also work on some side-projects like an App for sharing activities or a trainings-recommender for girls based on their hormone cycle but they are not commented enough to make them open source yet.
