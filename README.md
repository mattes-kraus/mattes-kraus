Hi, I am Mattes.

I am a Robotics student in Germany, specializing in Imitation Learning and robot swarms! I studied Computer Science in Konstanz and now start my masters at TUM in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence.

Feel free to check out my works towards my thesis or my small hangman solver. I also work on some side-projects like an App for sharing activities or a trainings-recommender for girls based on their hormone cycle but they are not far enough to make them open source yet.
